1. Build "Puppy lover’s page"
    ● Steps:
        ○  Start by building ONLY the HTML
         structure of the Puppy
         Lover’s page. This process is clearly explained under Basics of
         CSS class videos, 4.5 - Thinking in terms of containers.

        ○  Start adding names to your HTML
        ○  Start styling your HTML using CSS
    ● Hint on how to organize your folders and files:
        ○ Create a folder called "Week-3" in your “Phase-1” folder.
        ○ Create a folder called “PuppyProject” in your "Week-3" folder.
        ○ Inside your “PuppyProject” folder, create two folders called
        “Resources” and “Project”.
        ○ Download the following zipped file, extract it inside the
        “Resources” folder.
            ■ The zipped file contains the images and design for the
        final puppy lovers page.
        ○ Inside the “Project” folder, create an html file called
        “index.html”. This is where you write your html code.
        ○ Inside your “Project” folder, create a folder called “CSS”.
        Inside of your “CSS” folder, create a file called “style.css”.
        ○ Inside of your “Project” folder, create a folder called “images”.
        ○ Go to your “Resource” folder and copy all the images from the
        “images” folder. Now, go to your “Project” folder and paste
        these images in the “images” folder.
    ● Note:
        ○ Always test every single line of code you write. Open it on your
        browser and check if it is working right. DO NOT proceed to
        the next step if your code is not showing the expected result.
        Fix the problem before heading to the next step.
        ○ Please seek help from your group members whenever you
        have issues. If your question is beyond your group’s capacity,
        bring your question to your instructors when you meet in
        groups
